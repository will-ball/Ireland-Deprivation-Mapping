## Mapping Deprivation in Ireland

This repository hosts the Rmarkdown file behind [this tutorial](https://will-ball.github.io/Ireland-Deprivation-Mapping/) for creating a choropleth map plotting Deprivation
by small area for Ireland. It also includes some of the data used and a folder of [plots](https://github.com/will-ball/Ireland-Deprivation-Mapping/tree/master/Plots).

You can follow the tutorial to create plots of the entire Republic of Ireland or for smaller sections, at county and electoral district level.

Here are some examples:
